Covid-19 Global Impact Dashboard: Comprehensive Analysis Using Power BI

Introduction
This project aims to create a comprehensive dashboard in Power BI to analyze the global impact of Covid-19. The dashboard will include various visualizations to provide insights into confirmed cases, deaths, recoveries, and other key metrics.

Step-by-Step Guide

Step 1: Open Power BI Report.
        Open Power BI Desktop.
        Import Dataset
        Remove all inconsistancies.
        
Step 2: Create Calculated Measures.
        Right-click on the dataset in the Fields section.
        Select New measures.
        Here I created the measures named as 'Acive cases','Average New cases','Average New Death cases','Average Recovered cases','Mortality Rate' and 'Recovered Rate'.

step 3:Start visualization in Model View.
       Customised the canvas as per the theme.
       Created First page with a title Covid 19: Spread Regional Insights.
       Added an Image for the Logo.
       
Step 4:Created Mutiple Card for Various Metrics:
       Go to the Visualization pane.
       Drag and drop the Card visual.
       Add fields into the Card visual:
       Put 'Mortality Rate','Recovery Rate', 'Average confirmed cases', 'Average recovered cases ' and 'Average deaths' in Fields.

Step 5:	Added Gauges for Total confirmed Cases, Active Cases, Deaths, and Recovered Cases.
        
Step 6:	Added Slicers for Month and Country/Region.
       
Step 7:	Added a Map for Covid-19 Latest Confirmed Cases by 'Country/Region'.
        
Step 8: Added a Clustered Bar Chart for Last week Confirmed Cases by Country/Region.
       
Step 9:	Added a Line and Clustered Column Chart for Cumulative Confirmed, Deaths, and Recovered by Date.
        Added another Clustered Column chart for Latest Cumulative New Cases, New Deaths, and New Recovered by Date.

Step 10: Added bookmarks and Buttons For the Specified results and Page Navigation.    

Step 11: Create another Page Based on the same theme and given the title as 'Covid 19-Spread :Global Insights.

Step 12: Added a Table with a title Global Pandamic overview for showing Various Metrics:

Step 13: Added Gauges for Total Cases, Active Cases, Deaths, and Recovered Cases.
        
Step 14: Added Slicers for Continents.
       
Step 15: Added a Map for Covid-19 Hotpots in Continents.

Step 16: Added Tree Map For Detailing the Global Breakdown.

Step 17: Added bookmarks and Buttons For the Specified results and Page Navigation.
         used the Drill through function and added one more button for the Latest Updates in continents.

Step 18: Create another Page Based on the same theme and given the title as 'Specific Updates of Pandamics.

Step 19: Added a Table with a title Latest Updates for showing Various Metrics.

Step 20: Added a Map for Selected Continents.

Step 30: Added button for Page Navigation.
       
By following these steps, I have created a comprehensive Covid-19 Global Analysis Dashboard in Power BI.
This dashboard will help you visualize and analyze the impact of Covid-19 across different regions and timeperiod, Global Cases Overview and its latest Updates.
